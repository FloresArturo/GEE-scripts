# GEE-scripts
Scripts for Google Earth Engine

Google Earth Engine is a powerful database of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. 
Images can be obtained easily by using the code editor of this platform. However, a Python API is also available with some restrictions. 

The GEE database can be accesed from : https://earthengine.google.com/
The GEE code editor from: https://code.earthengine.google.com/

Users will need to set up a free account and create project where imagery will be downloaded to. 
In this repository I will be sharing some default codes that allow users to perform different actions with minumum knowldege on the platform.
There is no intention on taking ownership of anyones codes, and most of what is uploaded here was created using the GEE guide that can be accessed here: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides
